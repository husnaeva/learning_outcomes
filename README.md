# Learning Outcomes

## Purpose:

1) we will use prairie learn interface to select problem banks for each test. Each test will try to assess a subset of the learning outcomes. 

2) instructors will need to browse learning outcomes to see what the “coverage” is of the problem bank. Example question: “how many questions are there that require both energy and momentum”

3) once the tests are done, students will get an email of all the learning outcomes they did NOT meet (ie got questions wrong) along with links to videos/readings to learn that material. 

4) if an instructor is using a different textbook, they should still be able to use our problem bank because there will be that Rosetta Stone linking learning outcomes between textbooks. This is what @stevecollins17 will be working on. 

So if we use those codes, all the above becomes a lot easier/better than carting around strings with full sentences.
